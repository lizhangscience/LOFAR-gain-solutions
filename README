Working directory on Dawn cluster at University of Groningen: /home/users/modhurita/LOFAR_gain_solutions

# Reading sagecal gain solutions:

The python files, read_{dd,di}_gain_solutions.py, read the gain solutions from the {direction-dependent, direction-independent} solutions files into .npz data files. The parameters that need to be set are specified at the top of these files.

# Example solution files:

dd_data_obsid_L205861_cluster_95.npz : Direction-dependent gain solutions, observation ID L205861, cluster 95. 

di_data_obsid_L205861_column_1.npz: Direction-dependent gain solutions, observation ID L205861.

# Plotting sagecal gain solutions:

The Jupyter notebook files, plot_{dd,di}_gain_solutions.ipynb, read in the respective {direction-dependent, direction-independent} .npz data files and produce the visualization plots.

# Results: Presentation.pdf

 Contains the results presented at the LOFAR Plenary Meeting in Groningen in February 2018.
